Dear lord forgive me


Design philosophies:
    - There 👏 is 👏 no 👏 such 👏 thing 👏 as 👏 self 👏 documenting 👏 code
    - Implement it in a way that when I fuck up it's easy to fix
    - Only use the standard libary unless necessary (i.e networking)
        - In order to insure code stability cuz im not maintaing this



Known differences/"features" between turtle and python:
    - Turtle -> every string is a multiline string! (easier to work w imo)
    - Turtle -> At the first line of a file, if a statment is indented turtle ignores it
                ex. program.py
                            ___________________________
                 -> Line 1 |      import module
                    Line 2 |string = "Hello World!"
    - Any backslash in a string must be escaped, even in a raw string
